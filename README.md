# company-website-practice

A practice project built with **HTML** and **CSS** (using Flexbox) to create a basic company-style landing page.  
The goal was to practice layout, spacing, responsive design, and structuring content effectively.

## Features
- Four main content sections plus a footer
- Flexbox-based layout for responsive structure
- Custom CSS classes for styling and formatting
- Placeholder text and images for demonstration purposes

## Purpose
This project was created as part of early web development practice.  
It demonstrates the ability to create structured, responsive web pages but is **not intended for production use**.

## Notes
- Buttons and links are styled to show a pointer on hover; they are not linked to external pages.  
- The design prioritizes practice of layout and formatting over polished visual design.
